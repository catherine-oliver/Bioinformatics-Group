# COVID-19 Vaccine Dashboard

## Purpose

The purpose of our COVID-19 dashboard is to help make information about the vaccine more publically available and easy to understand. As well, the dashboard will serve as a way to upload and save an image of your COVID-19 vaccine card for easy retrieval and back-up storage.

## Usage

In future releases, we plan to have our application hosted on a server, however it is running locally for now. To run the application, first clone the git repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/catherine-oliver/Bioinformatics-Group.git
```

Next, navigate into the bioi-group-project-front-end directory and run the following command:

```
npm run serve
```

Now the front-end application can be accessed from the url **localhost:8080**

The back-end api can be started by navigating to the back-end directory, and running:

```
source flaskenv/Scripts/activate
set FLASK_APP=api.py
python -m flask run
```

## Functionality
### General Information

The general information page contains a summary of what the COVID-19 vaccine is and how it generates immunity within our bodies. We have included data from peer-reviewed sources, as well as a video from Simple Explained (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnxrdFPXJMeHru_b4Q_vTPQ) which can help make sense of the scientific jargon surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, we have a section discussing the safety of the vaccine supported by peer-reviewed literature. 

### Vaccine Data Visualization

The data visualization page allows users to retrieve data regarding vaccinated individuals in the US. The page contains an interactive map of the United States on the left side, which the users can click to select a state. Beneath this, there is a form where the users can also select an age range and a vaccine manufacturer. The state selection is required, and the age range and vaccine manufacturer are optional. Once the desired filtered have been selected, the user can press the submit button. The number of vaccinated individuals in each category will be displayed in the right side of the page.

### Vaccine Card Storage

The vaccine card storage functionality consists of 3 pages that work together to allow individuals to store and retrieve their vaccine card. The image itself is tied to an account. A user can create an account on the Create Account page which requires a username, an 8+ character long password, and an image file to be submitted. Next, a user can login using their username and password on the login page. Upon a successful login, the user will be directed to the vaccine card viewing page where their vaccine will be displayed.
