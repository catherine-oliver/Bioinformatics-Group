<div class="textblock"><p>A sax-style non-validating parser for XML.</p>
<p>Saxes is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js">sax</a> 1.2.4. All mentions of sax in this project's documentation are references to sax 1.2.4.</p>
<p>Designed with <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node</a> in mind, but should work fine in the browser or other CommonJS implementations.</p>
<p>Saxes does not support Node versions older than 8.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md26513"></a>
Notable Differences from Sax.</h1>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Saxes aims to be much stricter than sax with regards to XML well-formedness. Sax, even in its so-called "strict mode", is not strict. It silently accepts structures that are not well-formed XML. Projects that need better compliance with well-formedness constraints cannot use sax as-is. Saxes aims for conformance with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/">XML 1.0 fifth edition</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-xml-names-20091208/">XML Namespaces 1.0 third edition</a>.</p>
<p class="startli">Consequently, saxes does not support HTML, or pseudo-XML, or bad XML.</p>
</li>
<li>Saxes is much much faster than sax, mostly because of a substantial redesign of the internal parsing logic. The speed improvement is not merely due to removing features that were supported by sax. That helped a bit, but saxes adds some expensive checks in its aim for conformance with the XML specification. Redesigning the parsing logic is what accounts for most of the performance improvement.</li>
<li>Saxes does not aim to support antiquated platforms. We will not pollute the source or the default build with support for antiquated platforms. If you want support for IE 11, you are welcome to produce a PR that adds a <em>new build</em> transpiled to ES5.</li>
<li>Saxes handles errors differently from sax: it provides a default onerror handler which throws. You can replace it with your own handler if you want. If your handler does nothing, there is no <code>resume</code> method to call.</li>
<li>There's no <code>Stream</code> API. A revamped API may be introduced later. (It is still a "streaming parser" in the general sense that you write a character stream to it.)</li>
<li>Saxes does not have facilities for limiting the size the data chunks passed to event handlers. See the FAQ entry for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md26514"></a>
Limitations</h1>
<p>This is a non-validating parser so it only verifies whether the document is well-formed. We do aim to raise errors for all malformed constructs encountered.</p>
<p>However, this parser does not parse the contents of DTDs. So malformedness errors caused by errors in DTDs cannot be reported.</p>
<p>Also, the parser continues to parse even upon encountering errors, and does its best to continue reporting errors. You should heed all errors reported.</p>
<p><b>HOWEVER, ONCE AN ERROR HAS BEEN ENCOUNTERED YOU CANNOT RELY ON THE DATA PROVIDED THROUGH THE OTHER EVENT HANDLERS.</b></p>
<p>After an error, saxes tries to make sense of your document, but it may interpret it incorrectly. For instance <code>&lt;foo a=bc="d"/&gt;</code> is invalid XML. Did you mean to have <code>&lt;foo a="bc=d"/&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;foo a="b" c="d"/&gt;</code> or some other variation? Saxes takes an honest stab at figuring out your mangled XML. That's as good as it gets.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md26515"></a>
Regarding &lt;tt&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE&lt;/tt&gt;s and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;!ENTITY&lt;/tt&gt;s</h1>
<p>The parser will handle the basic XML entities in text nodes and attribute values: <code>&amp; &lt; &gt; ' &quot;</code>. It's possible to define additional entities in XML by putting them in the DTD. This parser doesn't do anything with that. If you want to listen to the <code>ondoctype</code> event, and then fetch the doctypes, and read the entities and add them to <code>parser.ENTITIES</code>, then be my guest.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md26516"></a>
Documentation</h1>
<p>The source code contains JSDOC comments. Use them.</p>
<p><b>PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT IS PUBLIC AND WHAT IS PRIVATE.</b></p>
<p>The elements of code that do not have JSDOC documentation, or have documentation with the <code>@private</code> tag, are private.</p>
<p>If you use anything private, that's at your own peril.</p>
<p>If there's a mistake in the documentation, raise an issue. If you just assume, you may assume incorrectly.</p>

</div><!-- fragment --><h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md26519"></a>
Constructor Arguments</h2>
<p>Pass the following arguments to the parser function. All are optional.</p>
<p><code>opt</code> - Object bag of settings regarding string formatting.</p>
<p>Settings supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>xmlns</code> - Boolean. If <code>true</code>, then namespaces are supported. Default is <code>false</code>.</li>
<li><code>position</code> - Boolean. If <code>false</code>, then don't track line/col/position. Unset is treated as <code>true</code>. Default is unset.</li>
<li><code>fileName</code> - String. Set a file name for error reporting. This is useful only when tracking positions. You may leave it unset, in which case the file name in error messages will be <code>undefined</code>.</li>
<li><code>fragment</code> - Boolean. If <code>true</code>, parse the XML as an XML fragment. Default is <code>false</code>.</li>
<li><code>additionalNamespaces</code> - A plain object whose key, value pairs define namespaces known before parsing the XML file. It is not legal to pass bindings for the namespaces <code>"xml"</code> or <code>"xmlns"</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md26520"></a>
Methods</h2>
<p><code>write</code> - Write bytes onto the stream. You don't have to do this all at once. You can keep writing as much as you want.</p>
<p><code>close</code> - Close the stream. Once closed, no more data may be written until it is done processing the buffer, which is signaled by the <code>end</code> event.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md26521"></a>
Properties</h2>
<p>The parser has the following properties:</p>
<p><code>line</code>, <code>column</code>, <code>position</code> - Indications of the position in the XML document where the parser currently is looking.</p>
<p><code>closed</code> - Boolean indicating whether or not the parser can be written to. If it's <code>true</code>, then wait for the <code>ready</code> event to write again.</p>
<p><code>opt</code> - Any options passed into the constructor.</p>
<p><code>xmlDecl</code> - The XML declaration for this document. It contains the fields <code>version</code>, <code>encoding</code> and <code>standalone</code>. They are all <code>undefined</code> before encountering the XML declaration. If they are undefined after the XML declaration, the corresponding value was not set by the declaration. There is no event associated with the XML declaration. In a well-formed document, the XML declaration may be preceded only by an optional BOM. So by the time any event generated by the parser happens, the declaration has been processed if present at all. Otherwise, you have a malformed document, and as stated above, you cannot rely on the parser data!</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md26522"></a>
Events</h2>
<p>To listen to an event, override <code>on&lt;eventname&gt;</code>. The list of supported events are also in the exported <code>EVENTS</code> array.</p>
<p>See the JSDOC comments in the source code for a description of each supported event.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md26523"></a>
Parsing XML Fragments</h2>
<p>The XML specification does not define any method by which to parse XML fragments. However, there are usage scenarios in which it is desirable to parse fragments. In order to allow this, saxes provides three initialization options.</p>
<p>If you pass the option <code>fragment: true</code> to the parser constructor, the parser will expect an XML fragment. It essentially starts with a parsing state equivalent to the one it would be in if <code>parser.write("&lt;foo"&gt;)</code> had been called right after initialization. In other words, it expects content which is acceptable inside an element. This also turns off well-formedness checks that are inappropriate when parsing a fragment.</p>
<p>The option <code>additionalNamespaces</code> allows you to define additional prefix-to-URI bindings known before parsing starts. You would use this over <code>resolvePrefix</code> if you have at the ready a series of namespaces bindings to use.</p>
<p>The option <code>resolvePrefix</code> allows you to pass a function which saxes will use if it is unable to resolve a namespace prefix by itself. You would use this over <code>additionalNamespaces</code> in a context where getting a complete list of defined namespaces is onerous.</p>
<p>Note that you can use <code>additionalNamespaces</code> and <code>resolvePrefix</code> together if you want. <code>additionalNamespaces</code> applies before <code>resolvePrefix</code>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md26524"></a>
FAQ</h1>
<p>Q. Why has saxes dropped support for limiting the size of data chunks passed to event handlers?</p>
<p>A. With sax you could set <code>MAX_BUFFER_LENGTH</code> to cause the parser to limit the size of data chunks passed to event handlers. So if you ran into a span of text above the limit, multiple <code>text</code> events with smaller data chunks were fired instead of a single event with a large chunk.</p>
<p>However, that functionality had some problematic characteristics. It had an arbitrary default value. It was library-wide so all parsers created from a single instance of the <code>sax</code> library shared it. This could potentially cause conflicts among libraries running in the same VM but using sax for different purposes.</p>
<p>These issues could have been easily fixed, but there were larger issues. The buffer limit arbitrarily applied to some events but not others. It would split <code>text</code>, <code>cdata</code> and <code>script</code> events. However, if a <code>comment</code>, <code>doctype</code>, <code>attribute</code> or <code>processing instruction</code> were more than the limit, the parser would generate an error and you were left picking up the pieces.</p>
<p>It was not intuitive to use. You'd think setting the limit to 1K would prevent chunks bigger than 1K to be passed to event handlers. But that was not the case. A comment in the source code told you that you might go over the limit if you passed large chunks to <code>write</code>. So if you want a 1K limit, don't pass 64K chunks to <code>write</code>. Fair enough. You know what limit you want so you can control the size of the data you pass to <code>write</code>. So you limit the chunks to <code>write</code> to 1K at a time. Even if you do this, your event handlers may get data chunks that are 2K in size. Suppose on the previous <code>write</code> the parser has just finished processing an open tag, so it is ready for text. Your <code>write</code> passes 1K of text. You are not above the limit yet, so no event is generated yet. The next <code>write</code> passes another 1K of text. It so happens that sax checks buffer limits only once per <code>write</code>, after the chunk of data has been processed. Now you've hit the limit and you get a <code>text</code> event with 2K of data. So even if you limit your <code>write</code> calls to the buffer limit you've set, you may still get events with chunks at twice the buffer size limit you've specified.</p>
<p>We may consider reinstating an equivalent functionality, provided that it addresses the issues above and does not cause a huge performance drop for use-case scenarios that don't need it. </p>
